<h1>Varbase Storybook</h1>

<p>This is a placeholder folder to build the static storybook on builds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This will show up when the setup fails to build or point in the right way.</p>
<p>or when the auto storybook build system fails with a bug in components.</p>
</blockquote>

To build the static Storybook:
Follow with <a href="https://docs.varbase.vardot.com/v/10.0.x/developers/theme-development-with-varbase/integration-of-varbase-with-storybook">Integration of Varbase with Storybook</a>
Make sure that the site is configured.

<code>
yarn install
yarn storybook:build
</code>

<blockquote>
<p>From this point onward, you can easily access the static storybook,
by going to <code>"http://PROJECT_DOMAIN/storybook"</code>.</p>

<p>This applies when the main domain, like <code>"mysite.domain"</code>,
is set up to point to the <code>"PROJECT_FOLDER/docroot"</code> directory.</p>

<p>If you have configured a subdomain, like <code>"storybook.mysite.domain"</code>,
it will instead point to the <code>"PROJECT_FOLDER/storybook"</code> directory.</p>
